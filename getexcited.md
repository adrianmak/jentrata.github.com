<h1>Overview</h1>
-------------------
<p>When exchanging business documents and electronic information between different organizations via machine to machine transfer, compatibility becomes a major issue and hence the need for universal standards like Electronic Data Interchange or EDI. 
However implementing EDI may not be feasible for small businesses or individuals thereby restricting the benefits of e-commerce only to larger organizations. This is where Jentrata Messaging Gateway is useful as it not only supports secure and highly reliable information exchange but also ensures that various public standards for information interchange like AS2 and ebMS are implemented. </p>
<p>
This is because Jentrata leverages full functionality of various data standards implementation all on a single gateway. On top of this, Jentrata is totally free to download and install as it is open source. This makes it very useful for all individuals as well as organizations who wish to modify and use it as per their own business requirements.</p>
<p>
The main reason why Jentrata becomes an effective business to business (B2B) gateway is because it uses different in-built modules that correspond to different message protocols like ebXML, AS2 etc.  So in a way it standardizes message delivery by simply using the module corresponding to a particular protocol thereby unifying the overall B2B messaging under a single administrative function.
</p>
<p>
Jentrata is a Java based web application which uses a database having JDBC connectivity. Specific messaging capabilities like AS2 and ebMS are provided by their respective plug-ins or modules which not only make Jentrata scale as per your needs, but also allow open endpoints. Encryption is by using SSL / e-certificates as per public standards
